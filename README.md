This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) blogging starter template. This version is using Next.js 14 App Router with [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Wisp](https://wisp.blog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=nextjs-blog-cms-wisp) for publishing blog posts.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js blog template out there that is easily configurable and customizable. It's perfect as an upgrade from blogs using Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Contentlayer, or ContentCollections.
